Overall Layout from Resolume

  The application has a dark-themed, multi-panel interface, typical for creative or media editing software.
  The layout is divided into three main horizontal sections:

   1. Top Section: A grid-based clip launcher.
   2. Middle Section: A monitoring and properties panel.
   3. Bottom Section (Implicit): The window footer with version information.

  Top Section: Clip Grid and Layer Controls

   * Layout: This section is a grid where columns represent groups of clips and rows represent layers.
   * Columns (Horizontally): Labeled "Column 1" through "Column 15" at the very top. Each cell in the grid
     below contains a thumbnail of a visual clip (e.g., "Gimbal\_Spheres," "MinimAltitude\_09").
   * Layers (Vertically): On the far left, there are controls for "Layer 1," "Layer 2," and "Layer 3." Each
     layer has:
       * An "X" button to clear the layer.
       * A "B" button (likely for Bypass).
       * An "S" button (likely for Solo).
       * A "V" button (likely for Video).
       * An "Add" button (Blend-Mode).
   * Transport Controls: Below the layer controls on the left, there is a transport bar:
       * BPM: "BPM 120.00" with + and - buttons.
       * Sync/Playback: Buttons labeled |<-, ->|, /2, *2, TAP, RESYNC, PAUSE, and METRONOME.

  Middle Section: Monitors and Properties

  This section is split vertically into two main panels.

  1. Left Panel: Output and Preview Monitors

   * Output Monitor: The top-left quadrant of this section. It has a title "Output Monitor" and displays the
     final visual output.
   * Preview Monitor: The bottom-left quadrant. It's labeled "Preview Monitor / Layer / Layer 1" and shows a
     wireframe representation of the content.

  2. Right Panel: Properties and File Browser

   * Layout: This is a tabbed or multi-paneled view for managing properties and assets.
   * Top Bar: Contains tabs for "Composition," "Layer," and "Clip." Below this is the name of the selected
     clip ("MinimAltitude\_09").
   * Properties Panels (Left side of this panel):
       * A series of collapsible accordions for adjusting parameters.
       * Visible panels include: Dashboard, Autopilot, Common, Audio, Video, Transform.
       * Within these panels are sliders and input fields for properties like Master, Opacity, Width, Height,
         Position X/Y, Scale, and Rotation.
   * Asset/Effects Browser (Right side of this panel):
       * A tabbed view with tabs for "Files," "Compositions," "Effects," and "Sources."
       * The "Sources" tab is active, showing a list of available generators and devices like Blank,
         Checkered, Gradient, Text Animator, and FaceTime HD Camera.
       * A search bar (Q) is present to filter the list.
       * A "RECORD" button is located in the top-right corner of this area.

  Bottom Section

   * Status Bar: At the very bottom of the window, "Resolume Avenue 6.0.7" is displayed on the left, and the
     system time "12:38" is on the right.



Here is a breakdown of the TrueLazer UI, noting the differences from the previously analyzed image:

  Overall Layout TrueLazer

  The layout is fundamentally the same: a dark-themed, multi-panel interface with a top grid, a middle
  monitoring/properties section, and a bottom status bar. However, the content and specific controls have
  changed.

  Top Section: Clip Grid and Layer Controls

   * Top Menu Bar: This is the most significant difference. The menu now reads: TrueLazer, Settings, Layer,
     Column, Clip, Output, Shortcuts, View. The "TrueLazer" menu item replaces "Avenue," and there's a new
     "Settings" option.
   * Clip Grid: The grid itself is mostly empty. Instead of video thumbnails, the cells are black with a
     "Layer Preview" placeholder text. This suggests the software is configured for live output or control
     rather than pre-loaded clips.
   * Layer Controls (Left): The layer controls are similar (X, B, S buttons), but the "V" (Video) button is
     replaced with an "M" button. A prominent "LASER ON/OFF" button with a status indicator is present above
     the grid, reinforcing the laser-control focus.
   * Transport/Paging: The detailed transport controls (/2, *2, RESYNC, etc.) are gone. They are replaced by a
      simpler bar with:
       * "BPM 120.00" with + and - buttons.
       * A "TAP" button.
       * Pagination buttons labeled "Page 1," "Page 2," "Page 3."

  Middle Section: Monitors and Properties

  This section is largely identical in structure to the other image but the content displayed is different.

  1. Left Panel: Output and Preview Monitors

   * Output Monitor: This area is completely black, showing no visual output.
   * Preview Monitor: This area is also black.

  2. Right Panel: Properties and File Browser

   * Structure: The panel structure with accordions on the left and a file browser on the right is the same.
   * Properties: The properties shown under the "Layer" and "Clip" tabs are identical to the previous image
     (Dashboard, Autopilot, Common, Video, Transform, etc.). This suggests the underlying engine shares the
     same parameters.
   * Asset/Effects Browser: This section is also identical, with tabs for "Files," "Compositions," "Effects,"
     and "Sources," and the same list of generators is visible.

  Summary of Differences

   * Branding/Focus: Changed from "Avenue" to "TrueLazer," with a dedicated "LASER ON/OFF" control.
   * Clip Grid: The grid is empty of thumbnails and shows "Layer Preview," indicating a different operational
     mode.
   * Transport Controls: The complex media playback controls are replaced with a simpler BPM/Tap and a
     Page-based navigation system.
   * Monitors: Both output and preview monitors are black, indicating no active visual content.

  In essence, this image shows the same software framework but configured as a laser control application
  ("TrueLazer") rather than a video mixing application ("Avenue").
  
Layer Control Breakdown

The buttons are arranged in a hierarchical layout, with a main layer area and a smaller sub-menu.

Left-most Controls

    'X' Button: This is the top-left-most button, positioned above the "Add" button and to the left of the "B" and "S" buttons. 
	It is a square with a height slightly less than the combined height of the "B" and "S" buttons and their surrounding padding. 
	Its function is likely to remove or deactivate the layer.

    'B' Button: Positioned to the right of the 'X' button, this is a smaller square button. Its height is about half that of the 'X' button. 
	The 'B' likely stands for "Bypass", allowing the user to skip the layer's effects.

    'S' Button: Directly to the right of the 'B' button, the 'S' button is the same size and shape as the 'B' button. 
	It's probably for "Solo", isolating this layer's output for editing or previewing without interference from other layers.

Layer Preview and Add Button

    Layer Preview: This is the largest element in this section. It's a horizontal rectangle, significantly wider than it is tall (approximately 2.5 times wider). 
	It's positioned to the right of all the left-most controls and displays a live thumbnail of the layer's output, giving a visual representation of what's happening on the layer.

    'Add' Button: Located below the 'X', 'B', and 'S' buttons, this is a small horizontal button with a downward-facing triangle icon. 
	It's about the same width as the 'B' and 'S' buttons combined. This button serves as Blend-mode selection.

Layer Label

    'Layer XYZ' Label: This is a rectangular button at the bottom of the section. 
	It spans the full width of the left-most control area. It serves as the primary label for the layer, and clicking it likely selects the layer for further editing in other parts of the software.


Header Controls/ Labels

The top row header buttons are positioned above and aligned with the controls below. 
The button labeled "Comp" is situated in the far top-left corner and is aligned vertically with the "X" button of Layer 3 below it. 
To the right of "Comp" is the "X" button, which is centered horizontally over the "B" button of Layer xyz. 
The "B" button in the top row is positioned just right of the top-row "X" button and is aligned with the "S" button of the Layer 3 control area.

The "M" button in the top row is located to the right of the top-row "B" button and is aligned with the "M" button located next to the Layer Preview. 
The large "LASER ON/OFF" button spans a width that is same with the "Layer Preview" button below it. 
Finally, the "Column 1" button is to the far right, directly above the empty column clip area.

In essence, the top row acts as a header or global control bar, with each button generally positioned to correspond to the specific control column underneath it.
